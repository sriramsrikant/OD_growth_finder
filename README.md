From original README.md:

The python program growth_curve_analysis.py was written in collaboration with Bryan Weinstein, with input from Yu-Ying Phoebe Hsieh and Marco Fumasoni, to analyse OD measurements over time. For a full description of the script, see the Growth Curve Analysis PDF. The program can determine multiple parameters, including maximum growth rate, lag time and saturation time, as well as an 'effective' growth rate for any defined period of time in the dataset.  See the Pop-GROC demonstration Jupyter notebook for examples of using the growth_curve_analysis.py program, and see the Plot-GROC demonstration notebook for plotting results from this program and for plotting the averages of raw data from multiple experiments.
